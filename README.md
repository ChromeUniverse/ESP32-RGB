# ESP32-based Wi-Fi RGB LED controller

Controlling RGB LEDs via Wi-Fi with MIT AI2

Check out my videos on YouTube over at [Lucca's Lab](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjpQ2w6Di2f-tyCiK6mVGlA?view_as=subscriber). I have detailed explanations & demos of this project over there.

### Change Log

__May 22nd__ 

* Repo created.
* ESP web server code version 1.0 uploaded.
* MIT AI2 App project file version 1.0 uploaded.

__July 10th__

* Changed AI2 project file name from "ESP32_Wi_Fi_Test (1)" to "ESP32_Wi_Fi_Test". Old project file name was causing issues with AI2's "Import project (.aia) from my computer" feature: "Project names must start with a letter and can contain only letters, numbers, and underscores".
